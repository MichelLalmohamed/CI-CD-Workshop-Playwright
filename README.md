# Playwright-playground

Node: v14.15.4
Npm: v6.14.10

## Playwright attributes
Playwright comes with auto-wait built in meaning it waits for elements to be actionable prior to performing actions.

Locators are the central piece of Playwright's auto-waiting and retry-ability. Locators represent a way to find element(s) on the page at any moment and are used to perform actions on elements such as .click .fill etc. Custom locators can be created with the page.locator(selector[, options]) method. 

Selectors are strings that are used to create Locators. Playwright supports many different selectors like Text, CSS, XPath and many more. Learn more about available selectors and how to pick one in this in-depth guide.

### Test Isolation
Playwright Test is based on the concept of test fixtures such as the built in page fixture, which is passed into your test. Pages are isolated between tests due to the Browser Context, which is equivalent to a brand new browser profile, where every test gets a fresh environment, even when multiple tests run in a single Browser.

## Locators
Selectors defined as engine=body or in short-form can be combined with the >> token, e.g. selector1 >> selector2 >> selectors3. When selectors are chained, the next one is queried relative to the previous one's result.

For example,

css=article >> css=.bar > .baz >> css=span[attr=value]

### Locator vs ElementHandle
caution
We only recommend using ElementHandle in the rare cases when you need to perform extensive DOM traversal on a static page. For all user actions and assertions use locator instead.

The difference between the Locator and ElementHandle is that the latter points to a particular element, while Locator captures the logic of how to retrieve that element.

In the example below, handle points to a particular DOM element on page. If that element changes text or is used by React to render an entirely different component, handle is still pointing to that very stale DOM element. This can lead to unexpected behaviors.

const handle = await page.$('text=Submit');
// ...
await handle.hover();
await handle.click();

With the locator, every time the locator is used, up-to-date DOM element is located in the page using the selector. So in the snippet below, underlying DOM element is going to be located twice.

const locator = page.locator('text=Submit');
// ...
await locator.hover();
await locator.click();

### Running tests
Install your node modules first!

Install playwright second!
npx playwright install --with-deps

Run all playwright tests
npx playwright test

Running a single test file
npx playwright test example.spec.ts

Running tests in headed mode
npx playwright test example.spec.ts --headed

Running Tests on specific browsers
npx playwright test login.spec.ts --project=chromium

Run the test with the title
npx playwright test -g "add a todo item"
